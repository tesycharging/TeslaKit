# Inspiration
I drive a Tesla Model 3 since 2019. The possiblity to connect to your car and bring some more additional value facinate me.
In 2020, I have officially release my app, called TesyCharging, on the App Store.
In the beginning I have taken the API provided by https://github.com/HamblinSoft/TeslaKit. I continued the work on the API and decided to make it available as open source, so others could build really cool apps too.

# Installation - Swift Package Manager
To add TeslaKit to a Swift Package Manager based project, add:
<sub>.package(url: "https://github.com/tesycharging/TeslaKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.1.2")),</sub>
to your Package.swift files dependencies array.

#################
# Usage
Add an ATS exception domain for owner-api.teslamotors.com in your info.plist
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
	<key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
	<dict>
		<key>owner-api.teslamotors.com</key>
		<dict>
			<key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
			<true/>
			<key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
			<string>TLSv1.3</string>
			<key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
			<true/>
		</dict>
	</dict>
</dict>
```

Add an import statement for TeslaKit into your file
	import TeslaKit

## TeslaAPI
Create a new TeslaAPI instance
Default:
```
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI()
```
Debug Mode:
```
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(debuggingEnabled = true)
```
Demo Mode:
```
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(demoMode = true)
```
Add Mock to your vehicles list
```
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(addDemoVehicle = true)
```

## authentication with your Tesla credentials using the oAuth2 flow with MFA support
Uses the WebLogin provided by Tesla
```
WebLogin(teslaAPI: teslaAPI, action: {
	UserDefaults.standard.set(teslaAPI.token?.toJSONString(), forKey: "tesla.token")
	UserDefaults.standard.synchronize()
})
```

## Token reuse
After authentication, store the AuthToken in a safe place. The next time the app starts-up you can reuse the token:
```
if let jsonString = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: "tesla.token") as? String, let token = AuthToken.loadToken(jsonString: jsonString) {
	teslaAPI.reuse(token: token)
}
```
## Token refresh
After reusing the token, it might need to be refrehed
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		_ = try await teslaAPI.refreshWebToken()
		UserDefaults.standard.set(teslaAPI.token?.toJSONString(), forKey: "tesla.token")
		UserDefaults.standard.synchronize()					
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

## Vehicle List
Obtain a list of vehicles associated with your account
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		let vehicles: [String:Vehicle] = try await teslaAPI.getVehicles()
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

## Wake up 
In case the vehicle is in status "asleep" it has to be wake up to request all data from the vehicle
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		_ = try await teslaAPI.wakeUp(vehicle)
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```
It takes up to 30 seconds after receiving the wakUp call till the vehicle changes it status to "online"

## Mobile Remote Access
Check if mobile remote access is granted to be able to obtain all data from the vehicle. To check if mobile remote access is granted, the vehicle must be in status "online"
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		let mobileAccess = try await teslaAPI.getVehicleMobileAccessState(vehicle)
		if !mobileAccess {
			//restriced to have remote access.
			//Process some code
		} else {
			//Process some code to obtain all data from vehicle
		}
	} catch (let error) {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

## Vehicle Data
Obtain all data for a vehicle
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let current_vehicle = try await teslaAPI.getVehicle(vehicle) else { return }
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

Generic approach to obtain all data or specific data, e.g. driveState
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let current_vehicle = try await teslaAPI.getVehicleData(.allStates(vehicleID: vehicle.id)) else { return }
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

or specific data, e.g. driveState	
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let driveState = try await teslaAPI.getVehicleData(.driveState(vehicleID: vehicle.id)) else { return }
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

## nearby Charging Sites	
Fetches the nearby charging sites
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		let chargingsites: Chargingsites = try await teslaAPI.getNearbyChargingSites(vehicle)
		//Process some code
	} catch (let error) {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

## Send Command
Send a command to a vehicle
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		_ = try await teslaAPI.setCommand(vehicle, command: Command.flashLights)
		//Process some code
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

Send a command to a vehicle with request parameters
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		_ = try await teslaAPI.setCommand(vehicle, command: Command.sentryMode, parameter: SentryMode(isOn: true))
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

# get Tesla account profile
Send a command to tesla.com when you are authenticated
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let user = try await teslaAPI.getUser()
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

# plan a trip
Send a command to tesla.com when you are authenticated. The result tells how many charging stops, how long it takes, etc.
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let tripplan = try await teslaAPI.tripplan(vehicle, destination: Location(lat: 37.485767, long: -122.240207)
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```
or define your battery level and location at start of the trip
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		guard let tripplan = try await teslaAPI.tripplan(vehicle, destination: Location(lat: 37.485767, long: -122.240207), origin: Location = Location(lat: 37.79307,long: -125.108), origin_soe: 0.5)
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

# set your trip destination
```
Task { @MainActor in
	do {
		_ = try await teslaAPI.setCommand(vehicle, command: Command.share, parameter:  ShareParam(latitude: 37.485767, longitude: -122.240207))
	} catch let error {
		//Process error
	}
}
```

# Streaming from Tesla's Websocket
Receive a continous stream
## start stream
e.g. at onAppear of a View
```
var stream: TeslaStreaming = TeslaStreaming()
@State var streamResult : StreamResult = StreamResult(values: "")
@State var streaming = false

func startStream() {
	if !streaming {
		_ = stream.streamPublisher(vehicle: vehicle, accessToken: teslaAPI.token?.accessToken ?? "").sink(receiveCompletion: { (completion) in
		}) { (result) in
			switch result {
			case .error(let error):
				print(error.localizedDescription)
				stream.closeStream(vehicle: vehicle)
				streaming = false				
			case .result(let result):
				self.streamResult = result
			case .disconnected:
				break
			case .open:
				print("open")
			}
		}
		self.streaming = true
	}
}
```
## stop stream
e.g. at onDisappear of a View
```
func stopStream() {
	stream.closeStream(vehicle: vehicle)
	streaming = false
}
```
